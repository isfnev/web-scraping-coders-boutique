Every company is a tech company.
We’re here to help ‘em all.
More than 3,000 tech teams, representing all industries and from countries around the world, trust HackerRank to connect with developers and add cutting-edge skills to their teams.
That includes 25% of the Fortune 100 — and that moonshot startup that just came out of stealth.
We’re discovering new ways of attracting candidates to the organization. By using HackerRank, we’re actually improving the tech image of UBS.
HackerRank has actually allowed us to look for diamonds in the rough that our old process
didn’t give us the time
or resources to look for.
We’re promoting our jobs to a much wider audience and allowing candidates to be selected for interviews purely based on the merit of their coding abilities.
We cut down hiring time by months, which was huge for us. We owe that to HackerRank.
HackerRank is a critical piece of our candidate’s experience, and hitting the right tone is just as important as identifying good candidates.
HackerRank has been a huge help in making it easy to assess the skills of all the candidates we
interview. Without it, the process of scaling our engineering team would have been very cumbersome.
