Testimonials:
1. Sean Rad, Former CEO of Tinder: 
   "micro1 makes it insanely easy to vet and hire the best engineers around the world. This has been game-changing for us."
2. Taher Hassonjee, CEO at DocDraft: 
   "micro1 has been a secret weapon for us in scaling our business. I almost want to leave a bad review to keep others away so that we can keep scourging the talent pool with limited competition."
3. Farbood, CEO of Briefcase: 
   "Ali and the team have been so awesome to build with. We are building and pushing builds together morning, noon, and night. The time between me designing and them pushing a build is usually the same day."
4. Jack Burlinson, CEO & Co-Founder at StageGlass: 
   "This might sound insincere because of how extreme it is: micro1 is the best service I have ever worked with. The engineers on the platform are 1/3 of the price of local talent and work harder, longer, and are more talented than almost anybody we’ve ever worked with. The platform is straightforward, and I’ve been so thoroughly impressed by them. I cannot recommend them enough."
