Former CEO of Tinder
micro1 makes it insanely easy to vet and hire the best engineers around the world. This has been game changing for us.
Taher Hassonjee

CEO at DocDraft
micro1 has been a secret weapon for us in scaling our business. I almost want to leave a bad review to keep others away so that we can keep scourging the talent pool with limited competition.
We've had an awesome experience working with Maria, Rahul and the team.

Ali and the team have been so awesome to build with. We are building and pushing builds together morning noon and night. The time between me designing and them pushing a build is usually same day.
Jack Burlinson

CEO & Co-Founder at StageGlass
This might sound insincere because of how extreme it is: micro1 is the best service I have ever worked with.
The engineers on the platform are 1/3 of the price of local talent and work harder, longer, and are more talented than almost anybody we’ve ever worked with.
The platform is straight forward and I’ve been so thoroughly impressed by them. I cannot recommend them enough.

Frequently asked questions
What is micro1?
AI recruitment engine to hire deeply vetted engineers fast.
How does the free trial work?
For any micro1 Talent engagement, the 1st week is on us.
Will the engineer work directly for me?
The engineer will be in direct contact with you and your company. You can also add the engineer to all of your company channels and softwares; however, you will not be directly hiring the engineer, you will be hiring micro1. Hiring micro1 builds a layer of abstraction for the legal, compliance, global pay, and benefits.
How does billing work?
The engineer's hourly rate is used as reference to calculate the total fixed monthly pay (in other words, their salary). This is done through a stripe subscription and there are no additional costs.
How are you different?
We use AI to screen thousands of candidates each month and certify only the top 1%.
Furthermore, the micro1 product suite allows you to hire full time talent, engage with managed engineering teams, or vet your own talent with our AI tool. All your hiring needs are in one place.
What technologies do micro1 developers know?
React, Node.js, AWS, OpenAI, Web3, ML, and much more
