The scale base also features shock absorbing technology with maximum overload protection of 150%.\u00a0The setup menu is accessible through the front panel for easy configuration and can be password protected to control access.\u00a0Setpoint values for over, under, and accept are easy to configure and a highly visible color coded light bar shows what the current status of the sample is.\u00a0It offers three different types of checkweighing: range mode, target weight mode, and target percent mode.\u00a0In addition, up to 50 unique ID's can be stored on the indicator for easy recall.\u00a0\u00a0For communication with peripheral devices the CW-90X comes standard with 2 full duplex RS-232 serial ports. Optional upgrades for communication include ethernet, USB or fiber optic.
