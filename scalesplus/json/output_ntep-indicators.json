The variety of functions include general weighing, parts counting, checkweighing, check counting, dynamic weighing, and with the addition of the discrete I/O kit, it can even operate in filling applications. Checkweighing is enhanced with a configurable 3-color bar matrix that ensures the operators are easily aware of the status. Other user-friendly features that allow for optimal performance include menu password protection, key lock, selectable environmental and auto-print settings, stability indicator, overload/underload indicators, and auto shut-off, auto tare. This Defender 6000 indicator also contains an internal library capable of storing up to 300 items including part number, tare weights, APWs, under/over limits, set points or reference weights.
