This allows flexibility while also further isolating the weighing chamber from environmental disturbances like vibration. The modular design also allows the operator to use the balance inside of a fume hood while operating the display from outside.\u00a0Four touchless IR sensors allow the operator to complete common tasks without touching the balance.
