An intuitive icon-driven menu guides the operator through all of Explorer's functions by way of a large 5.7 inch color touchscreen display. Explorer features a modular design allowing the display to be separated from the base of the balance. This allows flexibility while also further isolating the weighing chamber from environmental disturbances like vibration. The modular design also allows the operator to use the balance inside of a fume hood while operating the display from outside.\u00a0Four touchless IR sensors allow the operator to complete common tasks without touching the balance. This reduces the need to touch the balance during operation therefore reducing vibrations and prolonging the life of the balance through less physical contact.", "Description paragraph 2": "OHAUS SmarText 2.0 Software utilizes graphical icons and messages to prompt the operator through the menu. This makes Explorer exceptionally simple to use, reducing the amount of time needed for training. Instructional messages guide the user through setup and calibration right out of the box.

Minimum weight indicator shows prominently on the display ensuring samples meet minimum weight requirements per quality guidelines.

The modular design also allows the operator to use the balance inside of a fume hood while operating the display from outside.\u00a0Four touchless IR sensors allow the operator to complete common tasks without touching the balance. This reduces the need to touch the balance during operation therefore reducing vibrations and prolonging the life of the balance through less physical contact.", "Description paragraph 2": "OHAUS SmarText 2.0 Software utilizes graphical icons and messages to prompt the operator through the menu.
