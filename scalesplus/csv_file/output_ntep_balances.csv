An intuitive icon-driven menu guides the operator through all of Explorer's functions by way of a large 5.7 inch color touchscreen display. Explorer features a modular design allowing the display to be separated from the base of the balance. This allows flexibility while also further isolating the weighing chamber from environmental disturbances like vibration. The modular design also allows the operator to use the balance inside of a fume hood while operating the display from outside. Four touchless IR sensors allow the operator to complete common tasks without touching the balance. This reduces the need to touch the balance during operation therefore reducing vibrations and prolonging the life of the balance through less physical contact.,"OHAUS SmarText 2.0 Software utilizes graphical icons and messages to prompt the operator through the menu. This makes Explorer exceptionally simple to use, reducing the amount of time needed for training. Instructional messages guide the user through setup and calibration right out of the box. Once setup is complete, the user can easily navigate through 14 different weighing applications supported by Explorer. Minimum weight indicator shows prominently on the display ensuring samples meet minimum weight requirements per quality guidelines. Up to 14 languages are supported providing additional flexibility.",The EX6202N/E is NTEP and Measurement Canada approved for use in legal for trade applications.

An intuitive icon-driven menu guides the operator through all of Explorer's functions by way of a large 5.7 inch color touchscreen display. Explorer features a modular design allowing the display to be separated from the base of the balance. This allows flexibility while also further isolating the weighing chamber from environmental disturbances like vibration. The modular design also allows the operator to use the balance inside of a fume hood while operating the display from outside. Four touchless IR sensors allow the operator to complete common tasks without touching the balance. This reduces the need to touch the balance during operation therefore reducing vibrations and prolonging the life of the balance through less physical contact.,"OHAUS SmarText 2.0 Software utilizes graphical icons and messages to prompt the operator through the menu. This makes Explorer exceptionally simple to use, reducing the amount of time needed for training. Instructional messages guide the user through setup and calibration right out of the box. Once setup is complete, the user can easily navigate through 14 different weighing applications supported by Explorer. Minimum weight indicator shows prominently on the display ensuring samples meet minimum weight requirements per quality guidelines. Up to 14 languages are supported providing additional flexibility.","The ingeniously designed draft shield features anti-static glass, ample space for sample weighing and 3 access doors. The top draft shield door can be flipped open or the glass conveniently slides back. The stainless steel bottom is easy to wipe down and clean.

An intuitive icon-driven menu guides the operator through all of Explorer's functions by way of a large 5.7 inch color touchscreen display. Explorer features a modular design allowing the display to be separated from the base of the balance. This allows flexibility while also further isolating the weighing chamber from environmental disturbances like vibration. The modular design also allows the operator to use the balance inside of a fume hood while operating the display from outside. Four touchless IR sensors allow the operator to complete common tasks without touching the balance. This reduces the need to touch the balance during operation therefore reducing vibrations and prolonging the life of the balance through less physical contact.,"OHAUS SmarText 2.0 Software utilizes graphical icons and messages to prompt the operator through the menu. This makes Explorer exceptionally simple to use, reducing the amount of time needed for training. Instructional messages guide the user through setup and calibration right out of the box. Once setup is complete, the user can easily navigate through 14 different weighing applications supported by Explorer. Minimum weight indicator shows prominently on the display ensuring samples meet minimum weight requirements per quality guidelines.

An intuitive icon-driven menu guides the operator through all of Explorer's functions by way of a large 5.7 inch color touchscreen display. Explorer features a modular design allowing the display to be separated from the base of the balance. This allows flexibility while also further isolating the weighing chamber from environmental disturbances like vibration. The modular design also allows the operator to use the balance inside of a fume hood while operating the display from outside. Four touchless IR sensors allow the operator to complete common tasks without touching the balance. This reduces the need to touch the balance during operation therefore reducing vibrations and prolonging the life of the balance through less physical contact.,"OHAUS SmarText 2.0 Software utilizes graphical icons and messages to prompt the operator through the menu. This makes Explorer exceptionally simple to use, reducing the amount of time needed for training. Instructional messages guide the user through setup and calibration right out of the box. Once setup is complete, the user can easily navigate through 14 different weighing applications supported by Explorer. Minimum weight indicator shows prominently on the display ensuring samples meet minimum weight requirements per quality guidelines. Up to 14 languages are supported providing additional flexibility.",The EX4202N/E is NTEP and Measurement Canada approved for use in legal for trade applications.

An intuitive icon-driven menu guides the operator through all of Explorer's functions by way of a large 5.7 inch color touchscreen display. Explorer features a modular design allowing the display to be separated from the base of the balance. This allows flexibility while also further isolating the weighing chamber from environmental disturbances like vibration. The modular design also allows the operator to use the balance inside of a fume hood while operating the display from outside. Four touchless IR sensors allow the operator to complete common tasks without touching the balance. This reduces the need to touch the balance during operation therefore reducing vibrations and prolonging the life of the balance through less physical contact.,"OHAUS SmarText 2.0 Software utilizes graphical icons and messages to prompt the operator through the menu. This makes Explorer exceptionally simple to use, reducing the amount of time needed for training. Instructional messages guide the user through setup and calibration right out of the box. Once setup is complete, the user can easily navigate through 14 different weighing applications supported by Explorer. Minimum weight indicator shows prominently on the display ensuring samples meet minimum weight requirements per quality guidelines. Up to 14 languages are supported providing additional flexibility.","Explorer precision balances come standard with AutoCal, OHAUS' advanced automatic internal calibration system. Explorer performs routine calibrations to help ensure accuracy is maintained.
