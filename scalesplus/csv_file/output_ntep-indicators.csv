With this accessory the indicator can store up to 1,000 weighing results which can then be transferred to a PC or system for traceability.",https://store-errhy7umuu.mybigcommerce.com/content/Ohaus%20Manuals/Defender%206000/Defender_6000_Indicator_Datasheet_US_80776620_A.pdf,https://store-errhy7umuu.mybigcommerce.com/content/Ohaus%20Manuals/Defender%206000/Service%20Manual%20Defender%206000%20indicator_EN%2030655625A.pdf,1 year manufacturer's warranty,Yes,20-043,,6 x D type batteries,,,,,,,,,,,,"1:75,000",,,,,,,,,14°F to 104°F / -10°C to 40°C,,6 lb,OHAUS,i-DT61PW,https://www.scalesplus.com/ohaus-i-dt61pw-polycarbonate-washdown-indicator-ntep/,Designed for use in the most extremely demanding washdown applications,"Includes an Ohaus specific EasyConnect connector, this simplified new installations on Ohaus scale bases that have the matching EasyConnect connector",Additional cord grip must be ordered separately if connecting through hard wire style,NTEP and Measurement Canada approved Class III/IIIL,"Up to 75,000 displayed resolution","Up to 1,600 hours of continuous operation with backlight off, one set of batteries allows months of use",Tool free access to the battery compartment,Durable polycarbonate design,Supports up to 4 load cells at 350 ohms,Knife-proof numeric touch keypad,"Colored checkweighing LED, with red, green, and yellow lights",Weighing,Parts Counting,Checkweighing,Check Counting,,"Kilogram, Gram, Pound, Ounce, Pound: Ounce","6-digit, 7-segment LCD display with white backlight, 1.8"" high digits","3 color (red, green, yellow)",6 function mechanical keys,3.3 VDC,Up to 4 x 350 ohm,Up to 3 mV/V,,,+/-2% or +/-100% of capacity,,,,,,,,,Menu password protection,Key lock,Customizable environment and auto print settings,GMP/GLP output with time/date,Auto shutoff,Auto tare,Overload/underload indicators,Stability indicator,https://store-errhy7umuu.mybigcommerce.com/content/Ohaus%20Manuals/Defender%206000/Instruction_Defender_6000_Indicator_EN_ES_FR_DE_IT_30572892_A%20%284%29.pdf,,"1:10,000",,,,IP68/IP69K,,,,,,,,,,Dynamic weighing/Display hold,Percentage Weighing,"Up to 99,999 (kg, g ,or lb)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The i-DT61PW carries a large variety of approvals and compliance ratings.

The indicator is fully constructed out of 316 stainless steel for top of the line protection against corrosion and carries an IP68 immersion/IP69K washdown protection rating. To go above and beyond, Ohaus even included a knife-proof numeric touch keypad in the design to ensure the integrity of the buttons. ","What really sets the i-DT61XWE apart is the variety of functions and features included in just one indicator. The most unique feature to point out is the touchless sensor which allows for hands-free operation, reducing contamination risk. The variety of functions include general weighing, parts counting, checkweighing, check counting, dynamic weighing, and with the addition of the discrete I/O kit, it can even operate in filling applications. Checkweighing is enhanced with a configurable 3-color bar matrix that ensures the operators are easily aware of the status. Other user-friendly features that allow for optimal performance include menu password protection, key lock, selectable environmental and auto-print settings, stability indicator, overload/underload indicators, and auto shut-off, auto tare. This Defender 6000 indicator also contains an internal library capable of storing up to 300 items including part number, tare weights, APWs, under/over limits, set points or reference weights.
