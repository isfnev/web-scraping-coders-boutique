A simplified user interface with on-screen prompts and a large bright dot matrix display provides a friendly operator experience with little training required. Durable construction including stainless steel platform, powder-coated frame and aluminum load cell allow for use in the most demanding industrial environments. D52 includes common industrial weighing modes and supports a 50,000 item library and 1,000 user profiles which can be downloaded and uploaded for easy set-up with the included Micro SD Card. Defender 5000 is GLP/GMP compliant with time and date for result traceability. Additional connectivity options include a second RS232, RS485 or USB device; Ethernet; and WiFi/ Bluetooth interfaces. Using the Analog Option (either 4-20mA or 0-10V) or the two In/four Out Discrete I/O, the new Defender 5000 indicator can also be used for systems including PLCs.
