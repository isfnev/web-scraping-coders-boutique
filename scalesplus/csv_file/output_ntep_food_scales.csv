Its piezo keypad can withstand contact from knives and is resistant to liquids and other contaminants. The CW-90X bench scale is constructed of 304 stainless steel and has an IP69K rating for both the indicator and the load cell which means it is very well protected from water damage. The scale base also features shock absorbing technology with maximum overload protection of 200%. The setup menu is accessible through the front panel for easy configuration and can be password protected to control access. Setpoint values for over, under, and accept are easy to configure and a highly visible color coded light bar shows what the current status of the sample is. It offers three different types of checkweighing: range mode, target weight mode, and target percent mode. In addition, up to 50 unique ID's can be stored on the indicator for easy recall.  For communication with peripheral devices the CW-90X comes standard with 2 full duplex RS-232 serial ports. Optional upgrades for communication include ethernet, USB or fiber optic.
